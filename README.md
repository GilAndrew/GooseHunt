# GooseHunt


-**Project Title: Goose Hunt (OOAD Project 6)**

-Team Members: Caleb Chatham, Andrew Gilfillan

-Special Instructions to Run Program:
1. Go to the appropriate Executables folder for you OS on the github
2. Download the files in the executable folder, (e.g. "Goose Hunt.pck" and "Goose Hunt.exe" for Windows)
3. Have both files in the same folder and run the executable "Goose Hunt.exe" file

-Note:
The game itself can run from the exported game files, and all .gd scripts can be opened and easily read in a text-editor.
However, .tscn files (amongst other Godot specific file types), can, but are not easily read by text-editors. The best way to read them is by viewing them through the Godot game engine (which is freely available for download).
